Zeno is designed to display realistic facial expressions as it interacts with people. Zeno is typically used to enrich learning activities and therapy sessions for children with special educational needs. Zenoâ€™s expressive face encourages users to relax, make eye contact and stay focused on the activity conducted by the robot.\n\n\nZeno can be programmed to pull 32 distinct facial expressions, recognise faces looking at it and adapt the angle of its gaze and facial expressions appropriately deliver information and respond to voice commands or instructions from a tablet, and record therapy sessions with the camera in its right eye."
