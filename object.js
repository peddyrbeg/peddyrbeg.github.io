The TV in the robot's chest lit up to show 'moving space\npictures', and the robot could walk forwards slowly while its arms moved and lights flashed.\nIt set a pattern for many other robot toys which followed."

	des:"Expressive humanoid robot; with quick-start guide in polythene sleeve; and charger, by RoboKind, United States, American, 2013-2016\n\n\nZeno is one of the most expressive humanoid robots that can be bought off the shelf. Zeno is designed to display realistic facial expressions as it interacts with people. Zeno is typically used to enrich learning activities and therapy sessions for children with special educational needs. Zenoâ€™s expressive face encourages users to relax, make eye contact and stay focused on the activity conducted by the robot.\n\n\nZeno can be programmed to pull 32 distinct facial expressions, recognise faces looking at it and adapt the angle of its gaze and facial expressions appropriately deliver information and respond to voice commands or instructions from a tablet, and record therapy sessions with the camera in its right eye."
